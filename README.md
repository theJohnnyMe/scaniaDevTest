#### Notes during development

###### Design
- I did not had Scania fonts so I have used Roboto for everything
- I made all corners of table "sharp" as only one had border-radios on - seemed off to me
###### Code
- I had issues with first version of Stencil - it was having issue with integration in React and Angular. Because of that I am sending my solution late - had to create new react, new angular and new stencil projects.
- I think issue was that while cleaning I deleted some of files needed for proper intergation - therefore in second try I did not clean unused files that come with React/Angular/Stencil projects.
- You can check it in commits, I did not squash them so you have entire history of development

#### Thanks for nice task, I enjoyed working on it. ;)
